However, of late my foreskin turns sore more so after masturbation. Normally, on erection foreskin retracts automatically but in my case, I have to retract the foreskin manually without pain.

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your concern. The swollen up vein could be varicose veins. And if you keep doing some activities that increase the pressure in the lower body or abdomen, it can give rise to immense pressure preventing backflow of the blood to the heart via veins. So, there is swelling in the veins. If you continue to do the same activity then you may lead to damage the valves in the vein. Now, at this stage, you may have a check up with some cardiologist to know the exact cause of the swelling. However, nothing to panic. Until then, I request you not to indulge in those activities that bring the swelling in the vein as a precautionary measure. You may continue with moderate activities that will anyway help you achieve the same result."

I developed acne when I first started puberty, and I picked at my face, which caused these scars. I have tried Vitamin C, and Mederma gel to lighten them, but nothing works.

Yesterday, she got her second shot and her beta hCG levels today were 141. I wanted to know how much time Methotrexate takes to low down those levels and I was wondering if we were a little hurried in taking the second dose so quickly.",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I hope you had taken the Methotrexate dose under supervision only. The usual protocol is to check for a repeat beta hCG on the fourth day of taking Methotrexate. Early testing may cause undue anxiety and panic as it takes some time for the levels to come down. Moreover, a few times the levels get slightly elevated after a Methotrexate. So stay calm and follow the instructions of the gynecologist you are following. Just report to the emergency in case of any acute pain, giddiness or bleeding."

      "answer": "Hello. Both your babies are extremely premature as well as extremely low birth weight. The main complication that arises is due to incomplete development of lung. So, immediate surfactant therapy and oxygen support would be required. The next common complication is sepsis. Complete asepsis is to be maintained. Tertiary level NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) care which should be handled by qualified neonatologist is the primary requirement. A complete aseptic environment is to be created. In my practice, I have very mixed experience in the prognosis. I have seen these babies succumbing mainly to the sepsis. As per me, the baby with more weight has a better prognosis. It also depends on the level of NICU care being provided. For more information consult a paediatrician online"

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. If you had sex on the 33rd day, then the test will not come positive so early even if you have conceived. It takes around two weeks to come positive.Although the chances are very less, you should rule out pregnancy. Do a test around 47th day.  Amenorrhea can be because of hyperprolactinemia as you are also having breast secretion. Get a serum prolactin and thyroid profile done. Stress is also one of the causes of delayed periods.

      "question": "Hello doctor,  I have a question about my soon to be 12-year-old son. Since he was 1 year old he has had febrile seizures about once a year. They only happen at night. When he is sick during the day I would give him Motrin or Tylenol. Through out the night and he would not have any symptoms. When he did not show signs of being sick that night his fever would spike. Two years ago we had his first video EEG and there were no abnormalities or no concerns. We did MRI, blood tests, and EKG all are normal. He had two seizures this year both while being sick. So the neurologist wanted another EEG. So we did a video EEG. The first night nothing looked wrong so she wanted to keep him another night. During the day he was getting sick he was running a little fever. So that night they choose not to give him Motrin to see if he would have a seizure and he did. It lasted a minute and was a full-body one. They looked over the tape and said there was no evidence of one coming on it came so quickly. They believe (but are not sure) that it came from the frontal lobe. They put him on Keppra for two weeks and then the doctor looked it over with her partners and they decide that Trileptal and Keppra would be what he needs. I happen to total disagree. He has never had a seizure during the day or one without a fever. I feel they so quickly diagnosed him with epilepsy without considering that all his tests are normal. That seizure they saw came on because we didn\\\\t give him medicine for his fever. Which to me seems like he has the rare case of febrile seizures lasting till the age of 12 years. He did not have any seizures last year but just two seizures this year. I personally want to try and build his immune system to stop him from getting sick to see if that will prevent his seizures. His father disagrees with me and agrees with the doctor. I believe the side effects of both these medicine out way the actual problem. I am just overwhelmed and stressed. Because I do not know what is the right thing to do? Can febrile seizures last to the age of 12? Is it rare for someone to have a seizure maybe once a year then not have any, then have one the next year? Does the medicine he is on sound too extreme? Please advise.",

There seems to be a deep breath one takes similar to when one is at the doctor and they say take a deep breath and then there is a much more satisfying deep breath one can take which seems to fill the upper lungs with much more air. It looks like the diaphragm (upper belly) moves out a little bit when this deep breath happens. Can anyone explain the mechanics of this? Why can this deep breath happen sometimes and not other times? It is as if I could hold a musical note for 3 minutes because their is so much O2 in my lungs.",
      "answer": "Hi. It is an interesting question. Your observation that sometimes you can take a deep breath that is a bit more satisfying than other times makes me a bit more curious as to whether you are in the same posture every time you try it. The diaphragm is a muscle that divides everything in chest from everything in the belly with a few orifices that help get certain things like your food pipe through. It helps to expand the lungs by moving towards the belly while to take a breath in thereby creating more space for the lungs. Since there is a finite potential space, I wonder if you feel the difference based on how much food you have had or what time of day is it. I suggest a more detailed discussion if you can provide some more information."

      "question": "Hello doctor,I am a 31 years old, who weighs 160 lbs and 5.10 feet tall. I drink alcohol on and off since I was 18 years old. Once I got back from deployment, I drank pretty hard with friends. I would say 3 to 8 beers every other night and then 12 to 16 on weekends. I quit drinking cold turkey a month and a few weeks ago, but then I started having weird symptoms. I get panic attacks, my heart would race, and I would get dizzy and light headed. About the same time, I hurt my lower back using an ab roller. Now, my heart still beats faster than it normally does, especially in the mornings when I first get out of the bed. It almost slows back down to normal when my wife and I go on walks though. My back is still hurting as I am waiting for my MRI, but I have been to the ER four times in a month with chest tightness and a racing heart. The last time I went, I was given Morphine, which brought all my vitals back to normal. Am I at risk for alcohol neuropathy or could the racing heart and sometimes shortness of breath be attributed to a potential back injury?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. After quitting alcohol, many patients get alcohol with ChatDoctor.  Chest tightness and racing heart can be because of some cardiac problem like rhythm disturbance or ischemic heart disease, or it can also be due to severe anxiety or panic attack. But it does not seem to be related to the back injury. Chronic alcoholismis a risk factor  for developing heart problem also. For back pain, you can get an MRI of the spine. As you have consumed alcohol for such a long time, there is a possibility that it might have affected your nerves already, which may be subclinical and can be looked for by doing the following tests"

It is right that tablet Azithromycin might cause heart disorder like increased abnormal rhythm and this is seen usually in the elderly age group.

See you need to give sufficiently enough time for healing of adductor muscles tendons, which is getting worsened by repeatedly stretching. No doubt that you need more range of motion, but the first choice is to promote healing and decrease the pain, so for that, you need to take physiotherapy treatment, like ultrasound with ice and laser therapy, which helps in healing. then gradually after 20 days, you may start with exercises.

I have always been too short, I am 1.68 meters now and I do not think that I will grow any longer. I am also feeling tired and sleepy all day long. I thought it was because of school and other stuffs and I just need some rest. But now during my holidays, though I have slept around 8-10 hours every day, I feel tired and sleepy. My black circles also did not disappear.My symptoms are as follows. I have signs of anemia, such as rapid heartbeat, headache, dizziness, pale skin through which veins can be seen and had little cracks at the corners of the mouth some years ago. I use to get sudden muscle spasms once per day or so. Since birth, I have been suffering from asthma and acid reflux. I have small individual red spots on torso, joint, bone and muscle pain for a few times a day and it does not hurt too badly. I have pop elbows for a year or so. I am getting pale sores in the mouth and bad teeth. I brush twice a day with an electric brush, but still many problems when I go to the dentist. I feel bloated and constipation. My stools are of bad smell and oily. I am also getting diarrhea a few times per week. I got hereditary hair loss and bald temples. I have a history of migraine including temporary blind spots in sight.

Sometimes, I suddenly see a very flashy thing in my eyesight for a few seconds. It takes long for me to fall in sleep after going to bed.

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Sorry for the pain you are bearing because of the prevailing situation. As you have already mentioned there is a cavity and when it reaches up to the pulp there develops an irreversible stage which generally is more painful during night time as we sleep. I think your tooth has reached the stage of irreversible pulpitis and a root canal treatment is now must in order to save the remaining tooth. So go for it as soon as the situation in your area gets better. For now, take Amoxicillin clavulanate 500 mg (thrice daily) for five days, Paracetamol 500 mg to thrice daily SOS. Do not take Paracetamol when there is no pain but do complete the Amoxicillin course. Additionally, you can take any one for gastritis if you have a tendency to develop gastritis with antibiotics. You can take PAN-D (Pantoprazole) or Omez (Omeprazole). Take them on empty stomach. Do salt water rinse regularly. You can apply clove oil at the site, it is a good anti-inflammatory. Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth. Do mouth rinses with plain water regularly so that there is no food stuck.  ChatDoctor.  I hope this helps."

      "question": "Hello doctor,So, I just got back from the dentist today but my dentist did not give me a chance to ask further questions today, she just said I have short roots and left. I suppose she was in a rush? Not to mention she discovered four cavities under sealants I have had in the past. I have been here checking online about short roots and making myself paranoid. I wish I had a picture of my X-rays from today to make this more clear. But my main concerns are just does this have anything to do with root resorption and are my retainers making my short roots worse? I have not had braces since I was 14 and I have always worn my retainers since. I cannot sleep without them. But are my retainers causing my short roots more stress? And can this lead to root resorption?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand how you feel. But, root resorption occurs in deciduous teeth prior to shedding. In permanent teeth, root resorption occurs during pathology/disease. Regarding the cavities, if it is not near to pulp (blood vessel of the tooth), you can get it filled. There is nothing to worry about short roots. If the cavity is near the pulp, you will have to go for a root canal and again short roots will not create a problem with that but the crown placement might be affected. Yes, orthodontic treatment causes mild tooth resorption for tooth movement but is compensated and retainers will not cause much of root resorption. You may genetically or developmentally have short roots. Nothing to worry much, if there is no pathology, problem or mobility. I would suggest you remove the retainers at night as the tissues need some rest (eight hours). I hope I have answered your doubt. If you want, you can add up further details like which tooth or any other symptoms associated with it, like pain or sensitivity or swelling, etc., in detail.

However, when I look at it in a mirror and try to wiggle it to check if it is definitely loose, you cannot see it moving at all, nor can I feel the sensation mentioned above. Is what I have just a loose sensation or is the tooth actually loose? I brush twice daily and use mouthwash once a day. If I continue my current cleaning regime, will the tooth tighten back into place?",
      "answer": "Hello. I understand your concern. Unless the tooth is visibly moving there is less to worry. The sensation you are feeling could be due to a number of reasons like less space for the tooth to be in position (crowding), excessive force from the opposing teeth (trauma from occlusion) which leads to swelling of the structures supporting the tooth, an infection to the minute fibers which holds the tooth in position or certain habits (grinding). A consultation with your local dentist is recommended. The treatment depends on the underlying cause and needs an in-person consultation. You may practice the oral hygiene you have been following.

And as I can gather from history above, the decision of supportive care only without any chemotherapy is taken. For gastric cancer, surgery remains the best palliative treatment specially if there are features of obstruction as seen in her case. But usually, surgery is not preferred in view of its invasive nature. Her symptoms can be explained by moderate luminal obstruction of the stomach. In that case, another option is to go ahead with percutaneous jejunostomy for feeding which bypasses the stomach and helps in maintaining nutrition. If such a facility is not available then an endoscopic feeding jejunostomy tube can be tried. Sadly only medications such as antinausea  ChatDoctor.  I hope this helps."

Secondly, you had protection (condom), that means there are no chances of pregnancy. As per my experience, there is no chance of pregnancy. If some precum touched without a condom, then there are chances, provided your menstrual cycle falls in the ovulation period, that is the 14th day of your period plus or minus two days.

      "answer": "Hi. I have read through your medical history and the present complaint as well. First of all, I would like you to know that receding gums is such a normal thing to happen especially at your age. You have also mentioned that there is no pain or decay in those teeth you point out. Ideally, filling procedures do not work for gum recession problems but only for decay or abrasions close to the gum lines. The reason why fillings are not recommended is that you lose normal shiny tooth surface and the bulk while the cavities are prepared and there are many chances that the filling material might show microleakage hence paving way for tooth decay. There are as such no particular risks for this kind of procedures with your medical history kept in mind.

      "question": "Hello doctor,I am 29 years old. What would be the specific symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy? I am having some nerve issues, they conducted two separate neurological exams (no conductivity testing just the general exam) but the neurologist did not find anything abnormal. I am a mild to moderate drinker and have been drinking for about six years. I do not binge drink or drink more than a glass or two of alcohol every other day or so. I eat very healthfully and work out. I have had all sorts of bloodwork and nothing has come up (Ac1, B12, thyroid, etc.). My MRI is scheduled in five weeks to rule anything else out.Doctor says my symptoms are anxiety but want to make sure. Symptoms include some weakness in my hands when I wake up, tremors at night, feelings that have changed over time in my feet. No official pins or needles, just some general \\\"strange\\\" feelings in my feet that come and go and change from foot to foot. I only had a feeling of burning in my feet twice. Sometimes there is a region that feels like there is something in my shoe. This has all come up in the past two months. Would alcoholic neuropathy take longer? Will it have more consistent symptoms? Will it show up on a neuro exam?The neurologist insists that I do not need conductivity testing. I just want to rule out alcohol before I drink anything again.

I am currently taking Spironolactone, Yaz, and Urex.",
      "answer": "Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of alcoholic neuropathy. Anyway, tremor is very common after years of alcohol intake. I would first recommend checking vitamin B1 plasma levels and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency. I agree with your neurologist, on the fact that when reflexes are present we can exclude peripheral neuropathy. But sometimes, single-fiber EMG (electromyography) would give more information on possible small fiber neuropathy. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements in order to help to improve your situation. You should discuss it with your doctor on the above tests. I hope this helps."

      "question": "Hi doctor,I am in real pain for past 9 months and my doctor is clueless after several visits. After a period of 38.6 weeks in latent labor, I had a vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (first baby). No ultrasound was done the very day of admission. With crowning left medio-lateral episiotomy was given. Extension of 1.5 cm up to anal sphincter was given and sutured. I gave birth to 3.6 kg baby girl. After 2-3 days in hospital I kept complaining about excessive pain and burning in that suture compared to others. I was told that it was normal. After a month I could barely sit and feed my baby. In follow up doctor told me it was normal and healing. After 2 months it worsened again and I could feel a hard lump in left side below my vagina and near anus. It has been 9 months now after my delivery and every 4th day or once in a week I get the lump tender, warm and hardness in between my vagina and anus, along with discharge of pus or light color blood which is immensely painful. It keeps coming back always. I am getting weaker day by day. Mild fever, stiffness in legs, body ache, inability to move and sit when the pus forms until it discharges from a hole that has been there always. The same hole closes each time after discharge. Which doctor should I visit? Please help me urgently. What can this be?",

      "question": "Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with a left branch bundle block a few years back. I have been under the care of a cardiologist to make sure my heart is fine since then. I have done stress echos yearly or every two years since and have been told my heart is otherwise fine. I just had to switch the other doctor because of insurance and my new doctor says old stress echos are irrelevant, that only chemical or nuclear echos work in patients with lbbb. Is this true? I have a strong family history of heart disease, my father survived two heart attacks, mother survived double bypass and my maternal uncle died from a heart attack, all were smokers with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I am a former smoker. I am a 43-year-old female. I have been exercising six days per week for over 20 years. My cholesterol is high 213 but HDL is 140 and triglycerides are low. I am a little put off by a nuclear stress echo and would prefer the regular exercise. But I want to know what this new doctor says is true? Then I guess I will have to go nuclear. I am currently taking Spironolactone 100 mg for acne, Omeprazole, and multivitamins. I just had an ultrasound of heart and EKG past monday. Doctor did not mention anything other than lbbb that was previously diagnosed.",
      "answer": "Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor  Treadmill test is not very informative in case of lbbb patient, however, stress echo either exercise or nuclear is valid. Stress thallium is the best test to be done in you. I guess you did not have any symptoms like chest pain or heaviness during stress test and if so it will still suggest the absence of significant heart disease.  In my opinion, there is not much difference between exercise echo and chemical stress echo and not invalid, but nuclear scans like stress thallium is certainly a better test. I would advise for a nuclear scan as it would be more informative. Anyhow, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have a low salt diet and monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish once or twice a week. Avoid meat, smoking, and alcohol if any. There should not be any abdominal fat deposition or obesity. Get your lipid profile and sugars tested once.  Take care."

I am very scared, I do not think I am pregnant because I check with a strip two days ago and it tested negative. I am just very scared because I feel it was the infection that is delaying my period and it is messing with my system inside. How dangerous are staphylococcus infections, and why have I not seen my period?",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcom to ciliiq.com. You do not need to be scared. Vaginal infection should be taken care of, but these infections are not uncommon in sexually active females. So do not worry. If there are no symptoms, taking antibiotics every time may not be the right thing to do. Just maintain hygiene. Staphylococcus infection is also not an uncommon vaginal infection, sometimes even contamination from the surrounding areas while taking swab may show such a picture. Period delay due to this seems unlikely. Wait another week and recheck in the urine. If still negative, see a gynecologist who can examine you and find out the reason for it. It could be hormonal imbalance or a uterine or ovarian pathology. I hope this helps."

      "question": "Hello doctor,I am 33 years of age, 165 lbs. I have had anxiety, fatigue, gynecomastia, low libido, no morning hardness, and muscle loss. My lab results came back with my free testosterone level of 9.2 and testosterone level of 485, is this considered low T?",
      "answer": "Hi. I have reviewed your query and can well understand your worries. Normal levels of testosterone range from 300 to 1200 mg/dL and can vary a bit with different laboratories. Yours is not that low but is on lower side for sure. Keeping in view all the symptoms you described, low-T can be suspected if not otherwise ruled out. Just for general knowledge, signs, and symptoms of low testosterone include a change in sleep patterns that may be insomnia or sleep pattern disturbances. Physical changes like increased body fat and reduced muscle mass or bulk. Sexual changes like reduced sexual desire, sexual dysfunction, or infertility. Emotional changes like decreased motivation, depression, lethargic. Worsening of sleep apnea if a patient already has it or if there are risk factors the patient will get sleep apnea possibly. Worsening of congestive heart failure in cardiac patients. Many of your symptoms overlap with low-T. You need further probing in this matter. Your treating physician would help you in this regard. Sometimes diabetes, infections, obesity or other factors may contribute to ending up with low-T. Your physician would rule them out for you."

      "question": "Hello doctor,I fell over seven weeks ago at a running competition (at the end of a race), and had subsequent knee pain, swelling and difficulty walking. I then proceeded to have an X-ray which ruled out any fractures and then an MRI which showed a partial PCL tear. I have been having physiotherapy on it since including leg strengthening exercises. However, severe pain still persists, no improvement from the pain felt two weeks post-injury. Does this indicate it is not healing?",
      "answer": "Hello. The pain indicates that you might give some more time for it to heal properly. Do not be in a hurry to start up your exercises. Partial PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) tear recovers well with exercises. So, you do not worry. Keep working towards pain reduction first before starting off any exercise routine. Work for range of movement in your knee. Once you attain pain-free movement with complete or at least considerable pain-free range, you can start off next level of rehabilitation. Till then, work on the recruitment of muscles and maintain whatever you have. Hope this is helpful for you. For more information consult a physiotherapist online"

We showed this video EEG report to the previous doctor and asked him why is the difference in his (abnormal) and elsewhere video EEG (normal) report.

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Is it sudden onset or gradually develops from last many days. If it is gradual and it is there since long time period, then it is most probably spondylosis both cervical spine.

Do you have any history of trauma to your spine, does this pain increase on neck movement, is it associated with tingling, needles and pins sensation, if yes then it further supports the diagnosis. You will need vitamin D level, X-ray cervical spine, spine AP/lateral view and further may need MRI if X-rays are not informative. The treatment for this is physiotherapy to release the nerve compression, traction, cervical collar, medicine and if none helps, then surgery. Till the time you can have tablet Neurobion forte once a day which is a nerve vitamin. You need to visit a neurologist for all these investigations.

      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Diplopia for distance vision is more common in neurological conditions. If you do not have any neurological problems (ruled out by MRI), other problems can be considered. In your case, as you have high myopia, it can be due to decompensated tropia (phoria). In myopia, there is a loss of accommodation since childhood. This will lead to loss or decrease of fusion (focus on an object). This may lead to intermittent diplopia. This can be improved to some extent by fusion exercises like holding a pen in hand and looking at the tip of the pen, bring it slowly near to your nose.

As of today, I am going to drink two liters of water a day and incorporate that into my lifestyle. What is it that I am suffering from? I have no pain whatsoever and no burning sensations. I do not have blood or cloudy or smelly pee. Will this ever go away? What can I do? I would really appreciate any help or professional advice. This is really starting to take its toll on my life, and I am beginning to feel really restless and unhappy. Thank you so much.",
      "answer": "Hi. This is definitely UTI (urinary tract infection). Sometimes, it becomes long-standing if you ignore it. You need to take antibiotics and plenty of fluids daily as a habit. Gradually, it will go. Do not worry. It is not the problem, which is not curable. To relieve your symptoms early, you can take some alkalizer. For more information consult a urologist online"

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This is most likely due to urinary tract infection. There is no risk of getting stressed due to that. UTI can occur in any female, but the risk increases after sex. But that does not mean that you should not visit a doctor. You can visit a doctor with complaints of burning micturition and for the pain in the abdomen. If you do not want to disclose your sexual history, that is your decision, urine analysis should be done to rule out infection. Antibiotic course with some precautions like avoiding sex during treatment, having plenty of water will help to improve the infection. This will not cause any risk or complications in the future if you take proper treatment. Remain relaxed. Antibiotics cannot be prescribed online due to legal problems."

Secondly, the likelihood of getting gonorrhea and other infections which you mentioned are very unlikely after three months. If you had developed gonorrhea, there would be discharge or bumps over the penis within one month. About oral HPV, if your sexual partner had this infection, then there is a possibility of transmission, but that too is very unlikely. If you had developed, you would have symptoms by now. There would be at least minute warts that would have appeared over the oral cavity or genitalia. So, do not get tensed. Be cool.

I had some sensitivity issue in the left lower wisdom tooth, and I consulted an endodontist.The sharpness of the cusp was reduced, and GIC filling was done for the mild decay. Now, I am eating only on the right side of the tooth. I have a fear of damaging the filling, and so I am eating food on the right side. Now, I do not have pain, but, occasional sensitivity issues.

I am attaching the images and X-rays. Please give your advice.",
      "answer": "Hi. If you have sensitivity on your wisdom tooth, you should re-evaluate the filling. However, if it is not severe and increasing in nature, please wait for sometime, and it can subside on its own. The presence of wisdom tooth will not interfere with the braces treatment. Usually, when the upper wisdom tooth of the same side is removed, it is advisable to remove the lower also, because without any opposing upper tooth, it is impossible to bite and it can cause supra eruption causing other problems. But it can be removed at the time if it causes trouble. It is not a mandatory procedure at this time."

Beforehand, I was shaking, had a loud beating heart and had a feeling of vertigo and anxiety. Afterwards, I was confused for approximately 15 minutes. I was being very active at the time and was bending down and rising several times to tidy up a room, which may have contributed to feeling faint or having a head rush.I am a 27 year old obese woman. My height is 5\\\\6\\\" and weight is 266 lbs with untreated bulimia that comes and goes in phases since the age of 15. For the previous three months, I alternated between low carbohydrate days, the days I accept as good days and bad days where I may binge and purge up to three times a day. I vomited 12 hours before my seizure and did not eat or drink anything after that. I had 5 hours of sleep and then drove an hour to work. After my seizure, my employer, who happens to be a doctor, gave me lots of water and tea and sent me to a GP. An hour later, I had a blood test and the results came back all normal, but borderline low potassium. My ECG scan is normal and nothing wrong with reflexes or balance. I do not have diabetes. I have also seen a neurologist, who has put the seizure down as isolated and unprovoked.I have not told my GP or my neurologist about my bulimia. My MRI and EEG scans are pending, but my neurologist said that they will probably come back clear. I have never felt my aura before as any indication of epilepsy, minor seizures or myoclonic jerks. I have also scared of my bulimia now, which is a positive. I realize that I am probably clutching at straws or in denial that I may have adult onset epilepsy. My question is that could my seizure have been provoked? Thanks in advance.",
      "answer": "Hi. I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you. From what you have narrated, I am of the opinion that your seizures were provoked or brought on by a combination of non-diabetic hypoglycemia, lack of sleep, dehy ChatDoctor.   Your neurologist has labeled this as unprovoked seizure since he was not aware of this. Because of this, they may diagnose this as epilepsy, when it is all the more possible that you had a episode of fits due to hypoglycemia and messed up electrolytes due to bulimia. By hiding your bulimia (eating disorder) to the neurologist and GP, you make it a risk of another worse diagnosis of epilepsy. Bulimia is a much simpler disease than epilepsy. My suggestion would be to tell the GP and neurologist the truth and get treated for bulimia and save your future.  Take care."

So, first of all, the exact cause needs to be ruled out. If Flexon MR (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, and Chlorzoxazone) and muscle exercises are not resolving the problem then an X-ray of the tooth should be done to check for any infection.

I understand your concern but I think as so much time has already passed and by God\\\\s grace everything is fine then I think it has not gone into the airway, problem erupts only when it gets stuck in the airway, it might have gone down through the digestive tract and shall pass out normally through faeces. The biggest question is whether it went inside along with breath or food? That will surely subside the confusion and the one who swallowed most probably can feel this. I would surely want to know which number tooth it belonged to in order to know whether it was bigger or smaller in size.

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Genital herpes can be transmitted to your partner sexually because it is an STD (sexually transmitted disease), whereas herpes simplex (HSV-1) can be transferred from one person to another via infected oral secretions while in close contact. But at times, there is a possibility of getting genital ulcers when you are infected with HSV-1. Hence, I would advise you to undergo lab test to know if you are infected with the virus or not. And if you are positive for HSV, then you will require Acyclovir, which is an antiviral medicine. Till then, I would advise you to take preventive measures to avoid transmission to other partners.

      "answer": "Hello. I can understand your concern. I need more details before commenting on the diagnosis. You have mentioned that some unnatural thing is trying to say something to you. Do you have the awareness that these thoughts are in your head only or do these thoughts appear in real? If these thoughts are persistent, repetitive, unwanted, and are resulting in distress, then most likely this is OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). It could also cause seeing things written on road or colors too. Please provide me more details in the follow-up. Revert with more information to a psychiatrist online"

Upon clinical examination, my doctor was not worried and suggested to monitor the volume of the tonsil in the upcoming year. I had underwent adenoidectomy during childhood.In the last few months, I have noticed that the same tonsil has gained in volume and now appears round, red and more swollen than before. It is not painful when I swallow, but I have the sensation that something is stuck in my throat (most probably a collateral effect of edema). I am attaching another photo of what it looks like today.

Three months back, my GP checked it again. WBC came back in range but platelets were low. Over seven years, platelets have been between 134 and 165. GP sent my CBC history to two oncologists for review of low platelets. One said do test for H.pylori, hepatitis c, and HIV. Did the tests, all came negative. Both the oncologists asked to follow CBC. My father died of multiple myeloma at age of 64. The other day, I noticed a small bruise on my hip. Probably no big deal but have a heightened awareness now. My question is due to my father dying of MM and/or my CBC history, am I at a higher risk of blood cancer? What or when should I be concerned, what to look for? I certainly do not want to go to an oncologist with a single bruise.",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Your CBC does not suggest multiple myeloma (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In the case of multiple myeloma, anemia can be there and clinical symptoms like a constant headache, kidney system related symptoms, etc., can be present. But as your father was having a history of multiple myeloma, you are also at risk. But it does not necessarily mean that you will develop cancer in the future, the risk can be there but exact percentage cannot be predicted. So if you suffer from any unusual symptoms related to multiple myeloma like a headache, affected vision, weight loss, bone fractures, fever, etc., then you have to consult a nearby doctor for detailed evaluation. Your CBC is not showing any dangerous finding but still, I suggest you investigate with peripheral smear examination report and serum immunofixation electrophoresis for further work up. Peripheral smear examination will show any abnormal cells if present and electrophoresis will help in identifying monoclonal M band if present. You can revert back with that report."

Make an alternate, give breast feeding when she wakes up, after two to three hours give breakfast, like that. If she sleeps for good hours during day time then, you need to make her engage in some play to reduce day time sleep. It will take time, but slowly, she will develop a proper cycle.

Many healthy people, as well as patients with other non-cancerous diseases like rheumatic diseases, diabetic nephropathy, chronic heart diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, sepsis, may have elevated levels. So there is high false positivity rate as well. But, since it is elevated and also you being asymptomatic for other diseases I mentioned that it is better to undergo an evaluation to rule out cancer.

In addition to eating disorder symptoms like restricted food intake, self-induced vomiting, menstrual disturbances, etc., the body weight has to be 15% below normal to diagnose anorexia nervosa. Based on your reported weight and height, your body weight and BMI (body mass index) fall within the normal range.

      "answer": "Hi. Before I answer, I would like to point out a few issues here. You have not mentioned the location of your tooth pain, whether it is on the right or left side. The right and left indicator on the orthopantomograph (OPG) are not visible on the scanned image. So, I am going to describe the findings as I see it. To my right and left, I can see there is decay in two upper molar teeth. Upper third tooth from my right and the upper third tooth from my left.The decay in the upper right first molar appears to be deep. Depending on the symptoms, if you have acute pain that is unchanged, persistent and disturbs your sleep, then the tooth will require root canal treatment (RCT). This is because the nerve of the tooth (pulp) has been involved by the decay. If the RCT is started right away, the tooth can be saved. The decay in the upper left molar tooth is moderately deep and can be filled, if you get it done right away. If delayed, then the decay is likely to progress and involve the nerve of the tooth (pulp), then root canal treatment would be the only option to save the tooth."

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Lung cancer occurring at 28 years is unusual and he is right to be concerned regarding familial risk. As far as lung cancer is concerned, there is no specific gene or syn ChatDoctor.  But studies have shown that if a family member who had lung cancer and was a non-smoker, the risk of lung cancer in them is high. There are genetic tests available which can detect such mutation and their risk of causing lung cancer. But these tests should be done in a patient who had cancer so we can identify the particular mutation. So that the relatives could be tested for the specific mutation. Most widely known mutation in such cases is EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which can cause familial lung cancer. If his sister was tested for this and was negative then there is no further need for testing. So even if we do the test in your friend and find some abnormalities, we will not be sure of their significance. It will only add to the anxiety of your friend. What I would recommend right now is to adopt a healthy lifestyle and avoid known risk factors for lung cancer.

      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I understand your concern. You are having lymph node swelling axillary post influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is a very safe vaccine. Although some may have local pain, swelling, and fever. Some may have local lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy is a swelling of lymph node (normal gland present in our body, which function as clearing harmful substances and providing immunity). Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process. It is a reactive response of the lymph node to the vaccination. So no need to worry. It can be managed by simple Paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medication such as Serratiopeptidase. It should resolve within a week. If it is associated with fever or any other site enlargement of lymph node you can visit your physician. I hope this helps. Reactive lymphadenitis. CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), USG (ultrasound) axillary lymph node.

Protected or unprotected oral sex carries no risk as HIV transmission through oral sex is none considering she has no oral bleeding or ulcers and you have no ulcer on the penis. Shower bath will not protect from HIV and vaginal fluids in the mouth during oral sex carries no risk as these fluids will be neutralized by lipases in saliva.

This was my right eye. The vision in the eye is 6/9 with glasses in the operated eye and 6/6 in the other one. Since the first surgery 7.5 months back I am on Predforte eye drops. When I taper them off to 1, the eye starts getting red. My last eye exam was a month back and the retina specialist suggested to have one drop morning and evening for another 14 days. He said there is a subtle infection in the eye. However, when I stopped taking the drops after 15 days, the eye got red again and I restarted it and the redness was gone. I am worried about when I will be able to stop it. Can you please explain what may be the reason and how harmful it is to continue? The eye doctor (retina specialist) asked me to recheck after three months.",
      "answer": "Hi. You might be suffering from inflammation, not infection. A steroid is usually given to control inflammation. The principle is to continue on the lowest possible dose of steroid which can keep inflammation in control. In the meantime, it is important to keep an eye on side effects of a steroid-like rise in intraocular pressure. You are on a low dose, you can continue but check with your surgeon periodically.

I was wearing a helmet and a chest protector and both of them had cracked as a result of the impact. The helmet strap had strangulated my neck pretty hard. Ever since I have been continuously having sensation pressure at the place where the strap had impacted. Activities like turning my neck, yawning, laughing cause some pain. Over the past five weeks, the symptoms have not improved. I am very worried because I am afraid I might have to deal with this forever. They did a CT scan and said that it was normal. Should I ask for an MRI? Could this be some kind of hernia?",
      "answer": "Hi. Sorry to hear about your injury. Since your CT (computed tomography) scan is normal, it is very unlikely that there is any bony or skeletal injury hence reducing the possibility of something permanent. It appears that there is some soft tissue injury in the laryngopharyngeal region or a cartilaginous injury that is resolving very slowly. This indicates an injury closer to the voice box region because of constant movements during speech, laughter and swallowing delay recovery. This may also explain why it is taking so long to heal completely. In my opinion, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is certainly indicated since there has been no improvement in symptoms for five weeks and to look for cartilaginous injury or soft tissue lesions such as a granuloma or hematoma following trauma. In addition, a video laryngoscopy performed by an ENT will help to evaluate the voice box and supporting apparatus internally for any injury (specifically the inter arytenoid region). A hernia in the neck or a laryngocele may be a possibility following neck injury but seems very unlikely in your case since there is no visible bulge in the neck which worsens on coughing, etc. There may be an internal laryngocele that may be picked up on video laryngoscopy. I hope this helps."

After his birth, my wife was given an injection to avoid future complications arising due to opposite blood groups of my wife and son. Two years later, she had an abortion.

Also, please advice, if there are any tests to ascertain the risk and medications to avoid the same.",

However, if you have a doubt then get an indirect Coombs test to make sure that there is no risk. The miscarriage could be because of some other cause and not because of negative blood group, as she has already been given anti-D. In case you are planning for pregnancy, get started with folic acid supplements. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online"

I have been playing sports when I was young (volleyball, tennis, and basketball) and I was fit for a long time. However, since I started with higher education (around six years ago), I tended to study in a semi-bent position in my bed. Recently, I started feeling a dull pain on the right side of the bottom of my spine, which persists until I either bend my spine upwards with a pillow or sleep.I also have to note that I sleep on my side, with a pillow between my knees. When I walk, this pain in the side of my spine increases (I do not feel any unbearable pain, it is just uncomfortable), but I feel a sensation from that spot in my spine to the bottom of my right leg (on the back side of it, mostly). Does this seem like a common issue? If so, please tell me what exercises I can do to prevent my spine from going bad? I am in a period of intense exams, and I need some advice on how to stop this pain?",
      "answer": "Hello. I read your concern. I feel the pain what you describe is due to bad posture adapted all these days. It could be a neural pain due to any disc issue and may not be a worse prolapse. This may warrant a thorough examination of your spine and hip. As of now, I recommend you to do spine extension with pillows frequently, avoid the semi-bent posture which gives you the pain. Do certain glute and core stability exercises. Keep a lot of icing often like once in two hours. Please do revert back to me after two days and let me know the status of the pain.  Take care."

      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. From your history it appears that, you are suffering from cholinergic urticaria or heat hives. This condition of being hypersensitive or extremely sensitive to heat or the response of sweating. People with this condition often wonder why they feel itch when they exercise or any time they seem to get hot. It can be sensitivity to cold water also. Heat hives can occur at any age and can come and go often without treatment but in some it persists. As you said, after exposure to hot or cold water the skin will become red and sometimes itchy lesions will appear. Itching or burning sensation during the initial attack is common, and normally goes away when the overall body temperature has cooled. No effective treatment is yet available to cure cholinergic urticaria except avoidance of trigger factors. Tablets like Levocetirizine or Desloratadine are only helpful for short periods. Avoidance of trigger should be your first priority. Oxyhive treatment is sometimes helpful."

When I got up to use the restroom, I noticed tingling in my lower leg and developed drop foot as a result. My first visit was to a podiatrist and he suggested me to visit a neurologist. The neurologist did not run any scientific test and determined I likely crushed my peroneal nerve and said to return in four to six weeks for physical therapy. About two weeks later, while lying in bed on my side, I noticed my arm tingle a bit and when I got up to shake it out the tingling eventually subsided. But, I have experienced weakness in that arm. Last night while sitting upright on my bed, my left leg began to experience a similar sensation. The limbs are still functional and the tingling does not persist, but it feels weak. The uncertainty due to the lack of scientific testing is weighing very heavily on me and the troubling issue is the onset of additional symptoms which are causing occasional unsettling stomach feelings due to the mental anguish I have been experiencing. Mainly the fact that all of my limbs feel weak are making me very concerned.",

Let us analyze your problems You have tingling in all four limbs and weakness in all four limbs. That is upper limbs and lower limbs on both sides, but onset on various days. The next important point which you have told is the mode of onset and the tingling eventually subsided. The following parameters can be found out only by a clinical examination and they are most important to fix the diagnosis. In the same way, need to get at least two investigations, nerve conduction studies and MRI spine. It can be either a peripheral vascular disease leading to low perfusion or a peripheral neuropathy. I would strongly recommend as well as request you to consult your neurologist immediately and treat these symptoms as top priority. 1. Nerve conduction studies.2. MRI spine. The symptoms suggest either it could be peripheral neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease. Revert back with the investigation report to a neurologist online.- Take care."

      "question": "Hello doctor,I have a 16-month-old child. When she was 10 months old, she banged her head between her eyes, inner left brow rather firmly on a blunt object. She was attempting to stand up holding onto a chair, and when she quickly sat, her head firmly bumped the bottom of the portion of the chair which is made of metal. She cried immediately and vomited once but otherwise seemed fine and in a short time was back to play. From all, I read online, and the other family around there was no need to go to emergency.A few weeks later, I started to notice subtle changes. She developed a deep scowl that seemed to favor her left side where she hit. Also, the mark where she hit still came out when she was upset (it still does) and rubbing ensued. I took her into her Pediatrician and told him all three weeks after it happened. I Showed him pictures of the chair where she hit as well as images of her the day after and tried to explain the scowl, the rubbing, and just how I felt something was amiss.He assured me she had none of the symptoms associated with severe head trauma. Six months later and a few visits then all for the same thing I am still unsure and wish we could have look to make sure no tissue or other damage has been done. My question is, if internal damage was done to a vessel or two or a small fracture occurred, is it possible for the symptoms to be slight at this time and if there is a minor ever so slight bleed inside, could it take months if not years for visible signs to occur and irreversible damage to follow suit? Would it not then be too late? Should I push for cranial sonography or MRI?",

Might be you are a very anxious mom. If you are much worried, you can go for MRI brain, if it comes out to be normal, your anxiety level will decrease.

      "question": "Hello doctor,I am a 32 year old unmarried man. I recently had sex with a girl whom I met through an online dating site. It happened one week ago. I knew her from the last three months and had very good communication with her. She said to be working in a good company. We went out one day and had sex. I used a condom while doing it. But during that time I had a cut in my hand and I had once put my finger in her vagina and also the used condom. I also happened to put my tongue in her vagina. The girl is in good health and I even asked her twice if she is HIV positive but she told she is not. I had this anxiety in my mind. I searched the online sites for the early signs and found that I a had little back pain and numbness and throat is feeling little strange. I have little dizziness sometimes. When I am trying to sleep I am shaking from the inside and not able to sleep. It is just seven days since I had sex. I am too scared and not sure what to do. Yesterday, I was feeling a little bad today it is little better for me, but my hands shake a little. Do you think it is possible that I have any symptoms of HIV? Should I look for a common symptom? As I said before the girl is just fine, no noticeable health issues. Do you still think it is possible for me to get HIV from her? What step should I take now?",
      "answer": "Hello. I have noted your concern. I would say that you have a very low risk of HIV due to unprotected oral sex. Unprotected oral sex is still less of a risk as compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex but the risk is not zero with oral sex. Protected vaginal sex is safe and a skin cut on the finger that is not freshly bleeding is not a risk. A cut that is a few hours old is self-sealing. As far as your symptoms are concerned they are non-specific and partly due to anxiety. Anyways you should take an antigen/antibody HIV screening test (P24Ag and anti-HIV antibody test) at four weeks and at six weeks for a conclusive result. Regards.

The area where the tonsils were there has to regrow the mucus lining and the lining should start functioning normally after a few days of growing. If you smoke cigarettes or weed the smoke will directly get adsorbed on the raw area making it vulnerable to bleeding, infection, pain, edema, swelling, and impaired healing.

I sometimes find it hard to face the light meaning like looking around on a sunny day. These things do not prevent me from seeing. I see even from afar but I see well when there is no much light because I cannot stand light well when I am watching something. I have read somewhere that they are called floaters and can cause blindness. I have started to see just one dot and now I see some more not too many but irritating. It has been years. However, I have only tried to tell a doctor but he said that there is no problem and I have not done any treatment. So, I need your help, please.",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. You have correctly described your floaters. Only thing is that it is perfectly normal as they are part of aging and will only increase with time. They develop as the vitreous jelly inside our eyes liquifies with time. So they move when your eye moves. They do not cause blindness on their own. They are a matter of concern only when there is a sudden shower of floaters associated with flashes. In that case, you will need an examination of your retina after full dilation of your pupil to rule out any break in your retina which if not lasered on time may proceed to retinal detachment.

The direct Coombs test detects antibody coated on red blood cells. In cold agglutinin disease, the IgM antibody coat the red blood cells. So direct Coombs test is for testing for cold agglutinin disease in which antibody-coated red blood cells can be detected. In this procedure, Coombs serum means AHG is used to detect the antibody. So if direct Coombs test is positive at low temperature (because antibody in this disease bind to red blood cells at low temperature) then it suggests cold agglutinin disease. However, clinical correlation in the form of liver and spleen palpation should be done along with peripheral smear examination report for further workup."

      "question": "Hi doctor,I have been diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy following a Tonic-Clonic seizure before nine years. From then before two years I was seizure-free having been put on Lamotrigine.Before two years I had another TC seizure and my dosage was raised (cannot remember the dose precisely), and I was seizure-free for almost a year when I had another TC seizure.At this point, my dosage was raised again to 125 mg twice a day. Despite this, I have had a number of absence seizures. This seizure was followed by a 24-36 hour period of not just extreme tiredness but very strange mental sensations, including what felt like a rush of intelligence as well as frequently repeating thoughts and unexplainable strange thoughts (not distressing - more like feelings of another time as well as what I guess are best defined as nonsense, thought trains about advanced concepts such as genetics or psychology).Following this, I had an MRI which reported nothing abnormal, say for a small number of tiny foci of T2 hyper-intensity within the all white matter of both hemispheres, non-specific. The areas of the left frontal lobe where there has been previous EEG evidence of epileptogenic focus were normal.All of the above paragraphs is directly quoted from the radiologist\\\\s letter to my GP. Since then, I have had two absence seizures with similar post-seizure symptoms.My Lamotrigine dosage has increased to 200 mg twice a day. Now I am having regular nocturnal seizures (two to four weeks), which leave me similarly confused and with the same weird thought patterns. I had one about three days ago where these symptoms were particularly acute, and have worried me greatly.In all cases, I recovered quickly and found sleep to be a major contributing factor to my recovery. Now, just over 48 hours since my last seizure, these symptoms have again subsided. They have occasionally appeared prior to seizures, making me think they are auras, but they do not seem to be anything like the aura descriptions I have read about.During a recent appointment with a clinical nurse, I was put on a new prescription of Brivaracetam (2x 25 mg) alongside the current Lamotrigine dose. I have yet to begin this.The fact that there is a little reference online to these symptoms is quite distressing to me, particularly given how bizarre they are. Are these potentially a result of the point of epileptogenic focus? Might they be a reaction to the Lamotrigine?My current medications are Fluoxetine 40 mg per day, Atorvastatin 40 mg per day, Metformin 2 x 1000 mg, 10 units insulin Glargine, Lamotrigine 2x 200 mg, Brivaracetam 2x 25 mg (yet to commence).",
      "answer": "Hi. As per the given information, I can understand that these symptoms are the effects of seizure, and unlikely to be due to Lamotrigine. The primary goal of the therapy is to control seizure episodes for which you have been prescribed Brivaracetam, you must start the new medicine along with the old one, with which the symptoms must go. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan may not reveal epileptogenic focus other than hippocampal sclerosis and some volume loss. The best way to find epileptogenic focus would be EEG (electroencephalogram), if possible can be done later if seizures are not controlled with the prescribed medicines."

My dentist said that I had a microfracture and so he placed the crown. I am still experiencing pain when I bite down but less sensitivity than before. However, now I am also going through a general pain in my lower jaw on that side too. It is not coming from any one tooth, but it does seem to be radiating from the back. Could the crown cause this? I am currently on Hydrocodone, Verapamil and Spironolactone. I wake up in the morning with pain on that side, but only since having the temporary crown put on. I did have some nerve damage to that side of my face from a partial parotidectomy two years ago. However, it has never affected my teeth.",

I am using to treat a back/chest problem I had two years back which the doctor prescribed Inozith-250 for me. I used the same drug when I had a similar problem and I am well.",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. No, Azithromycin and Amoxicillin plus Clavulanate potassium work via different mechanisms. Azithromycin is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. Azithromycin is a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thus stopping bacterial growth. That is, it is bacteriostatic. Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death thus it is a bactericidal compound while Clavulanic acid is a \\\\xce\\\\xb2-lactam  ChatDoctor.  While not effective by itself as an antibiotic, when combined with penicillin-group antibiotics, it can overcome antibiotic resistance in bacteria that secrete \\\\xce\\\\xb2-lactamase, which otherwise inactivates most Penicillins.

      "question": "Hello doctor,I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years back. Another doctor changed the diagnosis to light bipolar. The last one told me it is just depression and anxiety. I had mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and Modafinil tablets. Due to an overdose, I gained a lot of weight. So, I gave up on the medications cold turkey and started work outs and medications. I consulted a homeopathic doctor and started medications for depression and anxiety. I plan to go a nutritious diet for managing the depression, which lasts for three to four days when I am not stressed and longer when I am. Can a person be hypomanic for more than three weeks if he is bipolar-2? I used my willpower to accomplish more as I was moving to another country. I prayed more and started doing all the things systematically with planning.As my faith got increased, I started to become compassionate with people, and very confident about things. I was very optimistic about getting a new job and believed that God would give me everything I needed. I felt most of the favorable things happening in my life as God\\\\s actions. I felt very happy and present at the moment. I was not euphoric. I was not talking excessively, not irritable, or low on sleep. I slept for seven hours at night. I was not jumping from one idea to another or jumping from one activity to another but I was finishing tasks systematically in a calm way. Suddenly, I felt bored and depressed one day as I was not able to follow up on my exercise, diet, sleep, and prayers. Then, within two days all the systems in my life crashed. I felt depressed and anxious. But, I did not cry. I feel angry and lost in thoughts about my past. I just sit with my phone the whole day and eat a lot for many days. Then my efforts come back to get back into the system. I connect the feeling of happiness that was there a few days ago as euphoric and being productive as hypomanic. Is this bipolar 2 or just depression due to unsystematic living?

Tiredness may also be due to blood loss and anemia during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the child takes up a lot of iron from the mother and also during breastfeeding. Check your hemoglobin level and contact me. You may also feel tired and weak due to lack of calcium. For which start taking more milk, curd, vegetables, and fruits.

My endometrial lining was 6 mm. They said everything else looked good. I have a history of ovarian cysts. Do heterogeneous cysts happen before or after ovulation? Do they impact menstruation? Also, what is the difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous ovarian cysts?",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. First of all, 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm are a very small size for a cyst. Because, in every cycle around ovulation one of your ovary makes around 3 cm follicle (cyst). In a sonography, if it looks clear without any shadow in the cyst, then it is homogeneous and when something is found floating in the cyst as echoes (shadow), then it is called heterogeneous. Homogeneous have clear fluid. In heterogeneous cyst, the shadow may be due to blood, pus cells, epithelial cells, other debris, hormones, enzymes or turbid fluid.  In 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm sized small cysts, it is not so much important that whether it is heterogeneous or homogeneous because it is mostly going to disappear around your period. Before ovulation, mostly follicles are with clear fluid. After ovulation, it may be homogeneous or heterogeneous with decreased size. Actually, it looks like disappearing follicle and not a cyst. A cyst can disturb your cycle only if it is of a bigger size and remains even after menstruation. Mostly it begins from unruptured follicle during ovulation and the size can be from 4 cm to 11 cm or even bigger in some case. This type of cyst requires treatment."

      "question": "Hi doctor,My husband has mood swings. He feels either depressed or very much excited. He is very irritable and gets angry for small things. This has started before four to five years. He sleeps for very less hours. He also drinks alcohol daily and goes for late night party in the weekend. Currently, he is out of a job and trying to start a new business. Does he need psychiatric help? His father is also under psychiatric treatment. Is this genetic?",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your query and understand your concerns. The information provided is not adequate to make a diagnosis. If he had frequent mood swings and lost his job due to mood swings or irrational decision, then there is a possibility of bipolar disorder where you have extremes of mood including depression and mania. The possibility of bipolar disorder is high as there is a family history and a history of substance abuse (alcohol), which compounds the problem. Out of 100 % with mood disorders, there is at least 50% have a family history of mood disorder. So, it can be said that this problem is half genetics and half environment."

      "question": "Hi doctor,When crossing a bar, I come across people smoking marijuana. Would a person test will be positive on hair or urine drug test in any situation? I am not a drug user.",
      "answer": "Hi. While crossing a bar, when someone smokes marijuana (Cannabis) out, there is a possibility of inhalation through the nose. Chronic exposure occurs for people who work in the bar. Sufficient amount can enter into the lung and blood, which can be tested in hair or blood. So, just crossing the marijuana smoke never makes the hair to accumulate marijuana or to make positive. There is a small chance for deposition of smoke on the hair. But, it would go off if washed while bathing. If the hair sample is collected after the exposure of smoke without a bath, then there is a chance for the test to be positive in the hair. If the sufficient amount of smoke enters into the lungs, definitely it goes to blood. Once it reaches the blood, it needs to get excreted through urine. Hence, within 12 hours of smoke exposure, the urine may show a positive result. For more information consult a toxicologist online"

You need not reduce the amount of feeding nor you have to start any other medication. The report is also fine You just need to keep breastfeeding the baby. Avoid any external or formula milk.

But, sometimes when you are eating or trying to make the contact then it is absolutely normal. This way the bonding is not going to get affected.

I mean repeat episodes or further complications. What should be the life style changes after resolution of acute episode (you know the nature of a pediatrician's job)?

Yes neuropathies are common at this age. Usually, it takes around 3 to 4 weeks for an acute episode to resolve depending on the symptoms. If proper care is taken (avoiding use of pillow, avoiding lifting heavy weights, neck exercises) usually symptoms do not recur. At present there is no need of surgery.

      "question": "Respected doctor,My 63 year old mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) 10 months ago when she complained of a severe headache. She has undergone CSF study and the report of the study is attached. She has been taking ATT medicines since then. The list of all the medicines she is taking is also attached. The medicines had come down to only one tablet (R-Cinex) in the last 10 months. But, now for the last two months, she started having back pain in the spine area and is now suspected to have a TB infection in the spine. She has a history of L3-L4 collapse four years ago, but that was due to osteoporosis. Her BMD score was -3.2. The spine has been severely infected from L1 to L5.  The MRI revealed an abscess with a pus collection in it (report attached). The doctor says it could be Pott\\\\s spine and may be because of a drug resistance (MDR), and they wanted to perform a USG aspiration for Xpert plus SRL, culture and sensitivity of pus. But, the test did not happen because the location of the pus was very deep in the muscle and could not be extracted. So, they extracted some tissues near by the infection area and sent for a small biopsy. The report of the histopathology (small biopsy) is also attached. It says mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. Since no strong evidence of drug resistance could be found in the small biopsy, the doctor has restarted the medicine of AKT-4 plus STM 0.75, and they want to see whether this reduces the problem or not. They said we cannot start DR/MDR treatment without any strong evidence of drug resistance. The current OPD card is also attached in which the medicine has been restarted. Now please guide us about what should be the treatment plan of the disease based on the information submitted. Can anything can be done to get a strong evidence of drug resistance since the ATT medicine is very heavy and the doctor has restarted this medicine only on the basis of his opinion?

I would suggest you not to stop the treatment abruptly as it usually leads to a flare. Instead, once the acne is controlled, you should reduce the frequency to a maintenance dose, such as weekly once or twice, for a longer-term. Salicylic acid peels do work well for acne and oily skin when applied correctly. You may need four to six sessions, with monthly one session frequency. Chemical peels even help to lighten your post-acne pigmentation. Do not prick your acne as it leads to infection, scarring, and pigmentation."

      "question": "Hello doctor,I was suffering from minor Achilles tendinopathy and visited a physiotherapist today to get it checked. During the session, he performed some deep tissue massage on the calf (which was very tight) to relax it, which was very painful. After the massage, I experienced sharp pains while walking (which was not there beforehand), and when I brought this up with the physio, he said it was normal because it was the first time I had gotten deep tissue massage on that area.I have been icing the calf and resting, and while it has gotten a little better, it still hurts to walk. I have my exams tomorrow which I have to get to and other events on the weekend where I have to be (and will involve walking). I am worried about how I can see as I cannot walk at all. Is it normal to experience such pain after deep tissue massage to tight calf muscles, or did I sustain some injury (say a muscle strain or something similar) and need to get it checked out?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your concern. Sometimes, usually, they try to break the trigger points, and it would have caused discomfort. The technique itself is pro-inflammatory techniques and will induce some more inflammation so that healing happens.  So do not worry. Now, I request you to ice your calf frequently like once in two hours for 15 minutes as of now and stretch it properly things should settle down fast. Tomorrow morning you might feel a lot of stiffness in the calf, do not worry as you have to stretch your calf gently and roll your calf over a foam roller or if have somebody ask them to massage it for few seconds. Things will be fine. You can walk without pain. I hope this is helpful to you. Kindly revert in case you need any further information in this regard."

      "question": "Hi doctor,I am a 30 year old female. I fractured my pelvis in a car accident on the 7th. I was on crutches for six weeks and am now walking the past few weeks without. The fracture was a tiny hairline fracture of the sacrum and another two hairline fractures on the side towards the hip. No fractures were in the joints and I was able to heal with no surgery. The problem is that I am still getting a lot of pain which alternates from the front round to the lower back, with the back pain being the worst as it is so stiff I am finding it very hard to walk. I also get numbness and tingling in my right lower leg and foot specifically at night which sometimes stops me sleeping. I am very worried this pain and stiffness are going to stay with me now specifically the back pain and stiffness. I was told I would make a full recovery although I do remember one of the many doctors briefly saying I could get lasting back pain in the sacrum even though it was so fine it could not be seen on the X-ray. I have been taking up swimming twice a week. I am not back at work yet.",
      "answer": "Hello. The pain what you have could be due to SI (sacroiliac) joint which in turn may inhibit butt muscles and develop spasm. I suggest you do a lot of icing on the sacrum and on the butt muscles frequently, for 15 minutes every two hours once possibly. Since there is a fracture, I am not recommending any massage or stretches for now. Do not worry. Everything will be alright as the tingling sensation and pain is due to spasm compressing the neural structures running below the muscle and will get settled down. Hope this is helpful for you.

My period started kind of light but is kind of thicker blood. I just had horrible cramps this afternoon, probably the worst ever. I took a nap and when I got up there was a large clot that looked like some sort of tissue. It was slightly smaller than an egg and was pink with dark spots.

      "question": "Hello doctor,I am a 24-year-old female and I was on the birth control pill Aviane for almost two years. I never had any negative symptoms and had an overall good experience but I decided to stop taking it after ending my relationship because I would no longer be sexually active. About four weeks after my withdrawal bleed, I had my first period again and everything seemed to go right back to normal. I have been off the pill for a year now, and my periods are totally regular, but I have noticed some slight differences. Before BC, my cervical mucus seemed to change throughout the month but now it stays the exact same. Thick and milky. Occasionally, it will be a little more watery, but it used to get that egg white consistency around ovulation and such. It does not seem to do that much anymore, if at all. Although I am pretty certain I still have ovulation pain around the middle of my cycle. Should I be worried? Did BC mess up my body? Or is that not cause for concern? Everything else is completely normal. My cycle is a perfect 28 days and my periods are back to how they were before. The only difference is that I used to still have some light spotting on day five, but now it is mostly gone by day four other than a bit of light spotting. I am not trying to conceive, but I was wondering if this was something I should be worried about. Thanks in advance.",
      "answer": "Hello. Firstly, birth control pills do not have this kind of lasting effect which might be over or after a year, so the change in discharge is not because of pills. Secondly, changes in consistency of vaginal discharge over the cycle are totally normal. These changes are due to hormonal changes which are taking place in different phases of the cycle. Thirdly, if the discharge is not smelly, itchy or associated with any abdominal pain or painful voiding then it is nothing to worry about. If any of these problems arise, you have to seek expert advice then only. Another general advice is to use cotton undergarments and wash area frequently with plain water only.   Take care."

They said her heart is weak and are unable to perform any test on the tumors. They have her on Coretec and albumin and said that it was not working and put her on something stronger.

They said everything was normal with no sign of cancerous cells, but are still unable to say for certain if it is benign or malignant.  I am just a very worried father.",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Firstly, there is a diagnostic dilemma. The reports you have uploaded (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are fine. But, you should upload the echo reports and the fluid investigations as well. Now, considering the pericardial effusion with multiple cardiac tumors, the possibilities of a rhabdomyoma or a teratoma are high. However, an effusion is not common with rhabdomyoma. It is possible to have some other cause for the effusion and it can also be as a result of a heart failure. Both of these are benign tumors. However, at this stage, we cannot rule out a malignancy. The next thing to be done is that she should undergo a cardiac MRI for further characterization of the lesions, which will give us a diagnosis and also resolve the issue of malignancy. Also, if the fluid is available, it should be tested for ADA (adenosine deaminase) and GeneXpert. She should also undergo a thyroid test. Rhabdomyomas usually occurs in patients with tuberous sclerosis, so she should be adequately examined by the doctor for the same. A definitive treatment is the excision of these tumors surgically. So, you can discuss this with the doctor as well. Hope this helps you. Do write back in case of doubts. Revert with more information to a cardiologist online"

      "question": "Hello doctor,My 13-year-old sister has been diagnosed with various mental disorders since the age of 2. My parents have taken her to doctors since then because they have noticed that she was not developing like the other children. Almost every doctor gave another diagnostic such as autism (each doctor suggested a different type of autism) and mental retardation. When she was approximately 6 years old, she was also diagnosed with epilepsy.At first, the crisis was happening only while sleeping and they were detected during an EEG by a doctor. He prescribed the first anti-epileptic drug which was Ospolot. My sister felt very sick from it so another doctor told us to stop the medication. We did and then she started having a different type of crisis, absence crisis while awake. The doctor then prescribed Topram. Throughout the treatment with Topram, another type of crisis was added beside the absence, that is myoclonus. The doctor then prescribed Depakine instead of Topram.The absence crisis stopped, but the myoclonus stayed. Besides Depakine, she started taking Rivotril as well. With this combination, she stopped having a crisis for 3 months, but then the myoclonus started again and nocturnal epilepsy crisis was added as well. During this period, the doctor tried to replace Depakine with Lamictal (Lamotrigine), but my sister became intoxicated from it and started suffering from the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She had to be at the hospital for one week to detox. My parents went to a different doctor then and he added Topram (Topamax / Topiramate) besides Rivotril and Depakine. This did not work again. My sister felt very sick from this combination while having a crisis both while being awake and asleep. She was then prescribed Depakine and Levetiracetam. The crisis while being awake stopped, but those while asleep still happen. At the moment, she takes Depakine, Levetiracetam, and Ospolot, but the nocturnal crisis persists.We do not know what to do anymore because the side effects of all these anti-epileptics have done a lot of damage. My sister is always very sleepy and drooling all the time. She already has mental issues so this just makes things so much worse.I know I wrote a lot, but I thought you should have as much information as you can.

If there are no rashes and only tingling sensation and pain, etc., over skin of lower shoulder blade, then most likely you are having notalgia paraesthetica. It is a superficial nerve disorder of the skin. For now, you can try a local anesthetic cream called EMLA which has Lidocaine and Prilocaine. Try it for a week or two.

      "answer": "Hi. Yes, your bite may go back to a previous alignment if you will not wear retainers properly. This will cause your whole treatment to relapse and it would be bad. Things you can do is you can put some oral gel at ulcer in the daytime and at least wear for 2 to 3 hours for a week so that ulcer may heal up and then come back to 14 hours of wearing from the next week. If some wire is hurting you and creating ulcer, get it fixed from your dentist and then start wearing.  If you cannot go to dentist urgently chew some chewing gum and put it on the point where it is causing the ulcer and wear it. Or you may put a tiny piece of moldable wax too at that point. It will not hurt that bad then and you can wear it. But do wear it somehow. Take care. Stay happy and blessed."

If it is the last tooth of arch that got broken it is the permanent molar tooth. It is the only permanent molar in arch till 12 years of age. If it is molar, it is some serious issue.

A permanent tooth from beneath might have given pressure for the eruption, and so milk tooth will be wearing off after becoming hollow. A hollow tooth is caused by cavities or a broken part of tooth.

      "question": "Hello doctor, I am a 38-year-old woman with bipolar disorder. I am taking Abilify 10 mg. I am experiencing vision issues (not blindness) that come every other day and stop only when I sleep. I used to take Artane for my vision problem that was caused by psychotic medicines, but Artane interacts with Abilify, and I can no longer take it. Can you suggest any other non-side effect medication to help with my vision problem or possibly a different antipsychotic medication? I have also tried Promethazine and it does not help. I have tried most of the antipsychotics and have had various problems with them.For instance, I was doing great on Latuda for a few years and then developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome from Latuda and had to switch to another medicine. So while I am open to changing from Abilify to another antipsychotic that hopefully does not cause vision problems, I have noticed most of the antipsychotics do in fact have vision changes listed as a side effect. Abilify works well on my bipolar symptoms and I am functioning well. I am employed full-time and feel calm, logical, motivated, and positive about life. It is the vision side effects that I desperately wish to get rid of. I looked into a new medication called Vraylar and read that it can also cause vision problems. Please advise me on what you think I should do. The vision problem is difficult to live with, I am dealing as best as I can but it is hard when it happens during work. It causes me to focus my vision on minutiae and it is hard to relax. To sum up, I am either trying to find a medication to help stop vision problems from my antipsychotic or be advised on a good antipsychotic that does not cause vision problems or changes.",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. So I understand that you are having ocular side effects with the use of abilify. There are a few ways to go about it. As you have mentioned that you are stable on the medication and functional, I would advise you to consult an opthalmologist and get a checkup done and see if they can suggest some symptomatic treatment to control the ocular symptoms. If it does not help you can ask your psychiatrist to either try to lower the dose which might help with the side effects, because as you said you are otherwise stable on this medication, so we have to try sticking to it. If that is also not possible, then we can think about changing the medication. Medications like Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Asenapine work well in bipolar disorder. As I see Haloperidol and Risperidone have already been tried. So we can avoid those. You can take an opinion of your current psychiatrist and start one of these medications. I hope this helps."

      "answer": "Hi. Your calculated body mass index (BMI) is 30.4 kg/m2. Generally we perform bariatric surgery to achieve permanent weight loss for any patient whose BMI is 30 kg/m2 or above. Liposuction is not a treatment option for weight loss. It is a cosmetic procedure for body shaping. There is a set point for fat storage for everyone. This is not altered by liposuction. Weight loss by liposuction, diet control, exercise, naturopathy, amway, herbalife, etc., is temporary, as all these methods do not have any effect on set point for fat storage. So, any fat that is removed in liposuction will reaccumulate over a period of 6 months to two years. Those who can reduce weight by diet control and exercise does not need liposuction and those who cannot reduce weight by above methods will not reduce even after liposuction. Bariatric surgery provides permanent weight loss as it lowers set point for fat storage. If you are looking for permanent weight loss then bariatric surgery is the only scientifically proven method for that.  Take care."

      "answer": "Hello. I have gone through your query. For an abscessed tooth, you have two options. One is endodontic treatment, and the other is the removal of the tooth involved in the abscess formation. Now, the treatment plan depends on the condition of the tooth crown. If the crown is in a good condition then you will be treated through a root canal treatment and if the crown portion is decayed or damaged grossly then you will undergo extraction of the same. Before visiting the dentist, you need to take an antibiotic prophylaxis for three days"

I attached her report and please tell me if there is a serious issue. Yesterday she got admitted with intolerable abdominal pain. Her doctor asked us whether she had any injuries on that area. But she never had any injuries. They prescribed some medicine and asked her to take an injection for two days. She was discharged home in the evening and last night she got severe abdomen pain.

In the liver, there is hemangioma which is a benign tumor meaning it does not cause any harm. If it increases in size, then it is resected. The other problem is with the muscles of the abdominal wall in which a small amount of blood is accumulated which is causing pain. It can occur after some trauma or injury to the site. It will also resolve in a few days. So I think hopefully she will get fine in a few days. Take care."

      "question": "Hello doctor,I am worried because my gum has been swollen and I was in on and off pain on the left side of my jaw after a filling two weeks ago. Before that two months ago, I had a crown lengthening, and I was supposed to get a crown, but the dentist two weeks ago said it is best to do a filling. Now I have what looks like a pocket or inflammation around the tooth that was placed with a filling.I saw that dentist today to get it checked, and she said it is the gum inflamed, and that I might need to lose the tooth or see the periodontist who might be able to fix it if it does not heal in a week. In that week, she told me to use mouthwash every day, floss extra diligently, and clean the area. Will this help, or am I in significant risk of losing the teeth? If I have to see the periodontist who did the crown lengthening, what would they do?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There are two conditions with your teeth, and it might be only due to overhanging filling or due to a pocket surrounding the affected tooth. In that case, you should go to the periodontist first, he will clean the area and give you a better idea of what is happening around the tooth. In the worst cases, it may happen that you will have to get your filling removed and get that tooth root canal treated. But all of this can be clear only after an X-ray. For now, warm water and salt rinse is a good option, no doubt but go to your periodontist as soon as possible."

After 13 days of starting the pill, had safe sex with a condom, but we doubt that it broke. To be safe, I took two dosages of Unwanted 72 the next day and stopped regular birth control. After eight days, I got bleeding, and it lasted for five days (same number of days as my regular period after stopping pills every month). What was that bleeding? Was that my normal bleeding or withdrawal? I am confused as this was near to expected period. Then, I did HPT, and it came to be negative. What are my chances of pregnancy? Does this bleeding confirm that I am not pregnant?Somebody suggested that I can start my regular birth control pills and I started. After 10 days, I got my full abdomen ultrasound done. It indicates that no focal lesion was seen and endometrial thickness is 4 mm. Uterus size is 88 mm - 43 mm - 42 mm. Do the thickness and report confirm that I am not pregnant?

We are flying two weeks after the procedure. We will be visiting a place with bad air pollution. Will she be more at risk of respiratory infection with no adenoids?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. At a place with bad air pollution, one\\\\s respiratory mucosa tends to get excoriated and irritated due to the harmful contents in the air.

Having removed adenoids does not make your kid very susceptible to respiratory infections although theoretically adenoids are supposed to help contain infection by acting as a portal of immunity for harmful organisms entering through nose and throat. But at two weeks post surgery, the area will still be slightly raw and healing would not be complete. Hence, that can cause more susceptibility to environmental pathogens.

But in electrophoresis report, M band is not seen which is classically seen in plasma cell dyscrasia. Moreover, Kappa to Lamba chain ratio is normal in the report. So, the chance of multiple myeloma seems to be less. But increased gamma globulin need further work up in form of CBC, serum calcium level, etc. In the case of multiple myeloma, the osteolytic bone lesion is also present. For that X-ray can be done in the suspected area. The gamma globulin increased in infection or inflammation as well. So your physical examination is necessary.

      "answer": "Hi. There is no relation between premature ejaculation (PE) and masturbation. Due to anxiety, the ejaculation will happen sooner. This can be managed by calming down and avoiding stress. Think that everything will be fine. It is normal physiology that during erection, veins appear prominent. Penis size varies from individual to individual. For thin people, the penis will appear longer, as the fat in the lower abdomen is less. Getting wet  ChatDoctor.  My suggestion is to distract yourself. Do meditation and yoga. Masturbate whenever you have the urge."

Till last year, I was having dandruff problem also, but after mundan (hair tonsuring), there is not much dandruff but hair fall has not stopped. Below are the symptoms.I used to wash my hair once in 3 days earlier. But within 2 days, my hair becomes wet even without applying oil.

The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well. I am having the teeth removed by an oral surgeon in two weeks, but am afraid of dying from infection before then. What are my options? What is the best course of action?

When you have been taking the pills regularly, the hormone pills will completely suppress the hormones causing the follicles to grow and ovulation will not occur.

You should wash your eyes with warm water mixed with a pinch of salt (similar to one prepared for gargling, but with lesser salt).

Perhaps it was another cause for hepatitis, may be hepatitis A which is transmitted through contaminated food rather than by sex. Hepatitis B and C are transmitted through unprotected sex or blood, e.g. transfusion or sharing needles. So, these scenarios can pose a risk of hepatitis. For raised bilirubin, I suggest you consult a physician kindly. I also suggest you screen for hepatitis A.

      "question": "Hello doctor,I have a question about hearing. Firstly, I am aware that hearing loss takes place when the tiny hair cells within the inner ear are damaged. My question is, once a particular hair has been damaged, will the same sound level that previously damaged it, hurt it again? For example, if you listened to a sound at 90 dB for nine hours and your hearing was damaged, would doing the same thing another day further damage your hearing? Or would it not change anything, as your ears would not be registering the same level of sound as the previous time?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There is something called a temporary threshold shift and permanent hearing loss. Temporary loss is the loss which if a sudden burst of sound and you get hearing loss as hair cells are fatigued however hearing regains soon in some time. If it is a permanent loss that too at a severe level for all frequencies chances are the person will not notice the same loudness of the sound afterward however there are some pathologies where the sound amplifies itself, and it is called recruitment. So in that condition, the person may not even respond to a loud sound of 80 dB however they might complain abnormal loudness at 90 and feel the same discomfort as a person with normal hearing has. It all depends on the pathology and condition of the hearing loss."

      "question": "Hello doctor,Is a 600 cc breast implant the same as a 500 cc implant filled to 600 cc? Is a 500 cc implant filled to 600 cc considered extremely large with more chance of rupture? Is going from A cup to C cup (350 cc) then going from C cup to possible D cup (500 cc filled to 600 cc) that big of a difference?",
      "answer": "Hello. I can understand your confusions. Let me tell you one thing. The implants are usually measured by three things, the volume, the base diameter and the height (profile). So the implants chosen will be on the basis of all the three criteria. An implant of 500 cc will have the capacity to be filled almost up to twice its volume (1000 cc) without being ruptured. It depends upon the surgeon that what volume will be good in your case. Again the material and shape of the implant determine the distribution of the additional fill. That all will be pre-decided by your surgeon. Going from A to C and then to D is not that much of a difference provided you do have that much skin to accommodate. If not, then the doctor might suggest a few months interval in between for the skin to stretch. For more information consult a plastic surgeon online"

      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Fraxinus excel is the common ash plant. It belongs to the olive family. Plants in same family have shared antigens. If you are sensitive to one plant in the family, you are likely to be sensitive to others also. Hence, the result means that you are sensitive to olive as well in addition to fraxinus excel plant. Being sensitive does not mean you are allergic. Sensitivity does not always result in allergy. Sensitivity means you have circulating antibodies against that particular allergen. However, it may or may not result in allergy to that particular antigen. Only when you are exposed to it in a particular format and quantity, you will develop allergy to it. Skin prick test only measures sensitivity to specific allergens. We need to infer the results based on your symptoms. What do you suffer from? Was the test done to check for aeroallergens or food allergens? The two are different with different symptoms. Kindly elaborate your problems to us."

Part of my overbite has returned since I got my braces off due to tongue thrusting. Partly because I never wore my retainers as much as I should have. Can I get a permanent retainer at this point? Or is it too late?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. First of all, you should wear your retainer regularly. Ideal position of teeth or occlusion which is obtained with the help of orthodontic treatment is maintained by regular use of orthodontic retainer. Use of orthodontic retainer is equally important and is part of orthodontic treatment. You can read about orthodontic retainer from ChatDoctor articles. As per your description, you have tongue thrust, so it should be corrected otherwise it will be a cause of relapse after successful orthodontic treatment. You can read about tongue thrust from ChatDoctor articles. As you have stated that your bite has relapsed, so if you use permanent retainer then it will retain faulty occlusion. This is what you can see about changes. But as the bite has relapsed, definitely there must have some other changes or movement of teeth happened (you have not uploaded any image of your concern area), that you cannot see but being expert in that field we can see. So for any kind of second opinion one has to check clinically or at least have an image of your concern area.

Though they increased the Nitropatch to 0.6 and started the beta blockers, I am having a fewer episodes.I had an angiogram last week. It showed no major arteries blocked. The cardiologist mentioned thickened heart muscles are due to high blood pressure. I would like to know how to get tested for the micro angina and is there a need to go to emergency when I have severe chest pain? Why am I getting chest pain with no major blockages?I have diabetes, copd, severe arthritis in my spine, and diabetic neuropathy in my feet that could also partially be nerve pain from my spine. I have had two knee replacements and at present have carpal tunnel in both hands but have not delt with that yet. Also with the thickened heart muscle, will that be the cause for acute chest pain?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Microvascular angina can be diagnosed on nuclear stress test with perfusion defects if any and also on angiography which shows slow flow in the absence of blockages in major arteries. So, if these tests are showing any abnormalities, then we have to consider the possibility of microvascular angina. Another modality is a treadmill test which can also show changes, but another test is not necessary as two tests are normal and you were not able to complete it. And microvascular angina usually causes pain on exertion rather than severe chest pain at rest. So we have to find other causes for it. If you had been evaluated or examined and had ECG etc., at the time of chest pain, then it also rules out other causes like vasospastic angina or accelerated hypertension as a cause of chest pain, which are relatively rarer causes. So, overall appears to be noncardiac pain. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."

It occurs earlier in myopes or people using minus power glasses. They are a matter of concern only if you see a sudden shower of floaters.

Since then, I feel I may have done damage to the smooth muscles in the corpus spongiosum or the tunica albuginea. I can feel, right inbetween the corpus spongiosum and corpus cavernosa what feels like an enlarged muscle and seem to run the entire length of the urethra, maybe compression damage done to something there. As a result, I have slight difficulty urinating and very very bad premature ejaculation which did not ever happen. I also have nocturnal emissions frequently on a full bladder. I know I may need to have an MRI, but if the muscles are damaged here, what are the surgical options? Can anything be done? I also tried Priligy and it made no difference (10 to 20 seconds).",
      "answer": "Hi. First of all, let me assure you, premature ejaculation is due to excessive sensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system and not due to any trauma. If the urethra is damaged because of foreign body insertion, then the only problem will be urethral stricture, which will cause difficulty in urination. Also, nocturnal emissions are natural, although frequency might vary. If you still have doubts, you can proceed with ultrasound Doppler study of penis and cystoscopy. That would reveal whether you have suffered any injury in the past.  Take care."

I have been told that if you brush your teeth within a half hour after drinking or eating anything acidy, such as coffee, beer, or tea, it could actually brush the acid into your teeth, causing more damage than brushing. The problem is that after each meal, I usually have the time to brush my teeth. A half-hour later, I am involved with something else and my teeth are the last thing that I am thinking about. Neither my dentist nor anyone else has directly answered my question.",

Such acidic foods damage teeth only if they remain in the mouth more than half an hour which cause some surface calcium loss due to the formation of calcium carbonate after salivary acids and other acidic foods react with tooth calcium.

My son has been suffering from regular cold cough problems since he turned 1, on an average three times in a month. Sometimes, the gap is longer when we are too careful and maybe the weather is stable. Starts with a runny nose, then cough, coughing is too much when he lies down, at night and early morning. Many times he also gets fever.We have visited several doctors and have been told it is RAD, we still do not know what is he allergic to, could be dust. In the past 2.5 years, he has regularly (when suffering) taken Allegra/Cetrizine, Nasivion drops, finished several bottles of Beta2, Salbutamol, Asthaline syrups, Paracetamol, sometimes but less of Azithromycin when it is throat infection, once or twice taken Kidpred also, also he has taken Montelukast 4 mg for certain intervals like taken for a few months and stopped and again taken.Three weeks back he got cough, we went to pediatric pulmonologist and were advised to start Budecort 200 inhaler twice a day for a year. Also, Asthaline inhaler three times a day for a week but still has cough. Allegra for a week along with Montair 4 mg. We did not start Budecort but started with Asthaline inhaler, Montelukast and Allegra. It improved and third week again he has got cold and cough but intensity is little less.My question is should we start Budecort 200 inhaler for a year and stop Montelukast? Or should we not start Budecort right now and continue with Montelukast for some time and check if it works? Or should we give both Budecort and Montelukast? Also is it fine to start with Asthaline inhalers whenever he gets cough? Lastly is there any way which we can find out what things he is allergic to? Or a list of common allergies?",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Please note that Budecort inhaler is the medicine to prevent or reduce these instances and Asthalin is the emergency medicine to control sudden bouts. Hence, without fail you should start and continue using Budecort along with Montelukast and use Asthalin on SOS basis. As far as the question regarding allergy to certain items goes, it is best to observe the child for the same rather than doing umpteen number of tests just for finding the causative allergens. Any which ways the chances of you preventing the child from coming in contact with such an allergen would be less only. So do not worry much about the allergens point of view."

So, you should be judicious in using products which supposedly while aiding skin regeneration are in fact, irritating or comedogenic. I am against using essential oils on the face, particularly because they usually do not suit sensitive skin and being an oil they can flare up acne which I am sure would be the last thing in the world you would be expecting, considering that you are taking these sessions to improve the appearance of your acne scars. Aloe vera gel is a good option and you can definitely use it post resurfacing sessions. Make sure you use a good brand and not raw aloe vera extracted directly from the leaves.

So, your report indicates ductal carcinoma in situ, and it is advisable not to take a risk. It is better to undergo surgery. For more information consult a pathologist online"

What I am worried is HIV 2 is a slowly replicating virus and worry that HIV 2 DNA/RNA PCR test cannot pick up even after three months. Is it true? Am I negative for HIV 2 if both tests comes negative after three months of exposure? Please advise.",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The replication of the virus has no relationship in the detection of the virus. If the virus is present in the body, the immune system will detect it, and start defending the body by producing antibodies. This procedure does not need any replication of the virus. It just needs a virus in the body. So, if the fourth-generation test is negative by three months and six months, then you are negative. No need to worry about them."

Now I am using Kojivit gel. Please advise me is kojivit gel safe? How to use it, and how many days it requires to cure the dull skin and become fairer again? Please give advice.",
      "answer": "Hello. Melacare cream that you have been using is essentially a triple composition of Mometasone Furoate steroid, Tretinoin, and Hy ChatDoctor.  It is not meant for regular use. This cream is a prescription product and should never be used without dermatologist advice. Dermatologist commonly prescribes it for facial hyperpigmentation and melasma. However, it should never be used as a regular fairness cream and in any case, not for more than two to three months. Since the steroid content of this cream can cause various side effects like acne, photosensitivity, skin thinning, and telangiectasia and facial hair growth (hirsutism), which is especially troublesome in females. I would suggest that you use a broad-spectrum sunscreen throughout the day. At night you could use Glyco-A (glycolic acid cream) or Kojic (Kojic acid cream) to obtain the desired results of brighter complexion and even tone. You could also opt for a few peeling sessions from a dermatologist, e.g., yellow peel (Retinol CT peel) or glycolic peel or lactic acid peel."

Right now he is under urine catheter. From past 12 days he is using Silodal-D 8 mg. Doctor said that after 20 days the prostate gland will reduce. Through ultrasound test we came to know the size of prostate enlarged is 54.6 cc. My doubt is, if it is enlarged to 54, is it possible that it can reduce through tablets? Or is it a must to undergo surgery? Right now the platelet count is 40,000. Please suggest a solution for this.",
      "answer": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Your father was on medication and has history of urine retention in the past. Currently, he is on catheter. Chances of medical management will not be successful. He needs surgery of either TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) or HoLEP (Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) for prostate. Size is never a criteria for surgery. Enlarged prostate can shrink by 30% if Dutasteride is given. But, this does not guarantee that the patient will become catheter free. However, it reduces blood vessels in prostate and helps decrease blood loss in surgery. Dutas-T (Dutasteride and Tamsulosin) also contains similar medicines as Silodal D (combination of Dutasteride and Silodosin). His ITP needs to be tackled and with all due precautions and keeping platelet concentrates on standby. He can undergo endoscopic surgery with due risks. Laser surgery - HoLEP will be better for him if available."

I never had any problem in getting an erection. I am an active guy who plays a lot of sports. Can you please help me understand what is wrong here. This is making me very nervous.",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. You are getting good erections, but are losing them when you try to penetrate. This is happening because of tight vagina of your partner. Because of this, you are taking time during penetration and this results in loss of erection. This loss of erection is occurring because of psychological reasons. You have tried long foreplay but this did not result in improvement. She still feels pain during penetration or when you try to insert fingers. This happens when girls start engaging in sex. You should use lubrication during sex. KY jelly can be used. You can also try using Lignocaine jelly. Ask her to apply this jelly to her vaginal opening. This will reduce the sensitivity and will reduce pain to some extent. You are losing erection because you are not able to penetrate her. There is no physical issue and this is due to anxiety alone.

      "question": "Hello doctor,Three weeks ago, I met a girl in a strip club and I was fingering her vagina for at least 30 minutes but without any intercourse or kissing or anything else. A week after this, I started having gas in my stomach and feeling strange and this continues till today. Ten days after this exposure and after I drank a liter of milk, I had diarrhea. The next day I ate, 20 minutes later I went to the toilet. Since then, I did not have such problem but whenever I am eating something I have this feeling that I need to go to the toilet and my stomach is \\\"playing all over.\\\" But, I did not have any symptoms of diarrhea. Also, I never had a fever during this period.Five days ago, I started having a headache and my nose was full and I was coughing like I had a kind of virus and I did not know if it was correlated with my symptoms in my stomach. I still have the feeling that I need to go to the toilet but when I go, it is either the gas or the normal stool. On day 15 after the possible exposure, I went to a clinic and I had done an HIV third generation test and the result was negative.When I asked the doctor what kind of test was that he mentioned to me the third generation but enforced which is equal or better than the fourth generation and this is what the doctor told me. My worries are if I have been infected with HIV by performing fingering and only that, and if my symptoms are related to that and if not what else might be. I am going today to give a sample of my stool for culture to see if I have any virus or anything else. In two weeks from today, my wife and I have decided to do an in vitro fertilization and therefore I am worried if the above are interlinked and I need to take any other action.Finally, my other question is linked to the latter. If I will take any antibiotics now for my stomach if they find also something in my stool and in two weeks, I need to give semen for the in vitro fertilization is this fine or the antibiotics will affect the quality of the semen? Should I do anything else with reference to my possible exposure to fingering?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There is really no chance of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection through just fingering the vagina as the virus is unable to pass through intact skin. There is not even a need to screen for HIV if fingering is the only physical activity that you have performed. Your stomach issues are perhaps due to indigestion and lactose intolerance. Milk and dairy products are a common cause of lactose intolerance. You can avoid dairy products for a while. I do not see any issues with your scheduled IVF (in vitro fertilization) procedure. You can go ahead with it. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online"

I get three hours of physio a week and three monthly blood tests, full blood count, TPO, and TSH.In your opinion what would be the expected neurological care for this condition, and the absolute minimum acceptable standard of care? Is an annual MRI necessary? Should a specialist be able to provide a prognosis on my condition? Any other advice you consider helpful to me.",
      "answer": "Hi. I am sorry to hear about your illness. You are likely suffering from Hashimoto\\\\s myelopathy based on your description. It is rare condition and only a handful of cases have been described worldwide. It is known to be very steroid responsive and there should be a remarkable improvement with steroids injections. If you had no response to the injections, I wonder about other diagnoses as well, given you have a history of cervical disc bulge causing weakness. The best way I can come to a better answer is by looking at the MRI images of the spine and brain, report of CSF studies with CSF level of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal antibodies. If we are seeing damage in the cord and the muscle power testing is weak with atrophy of muscles, for the past three years, then the recovery will be guarded. I will strongly advise, rehabilitation with PT, OT and botulinum toxin injections or spinal cord pump installation if significant spasticity is there in both legs.  Take care."

      "question": "Hello doctor,My partner has a cold sore. I kissed him before it actually looked like one. I already carry HSV1, but I have never had a cold sore. Did I put myself at risk?",
      "answer": "Hello. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) if once acquired stays lifelong. When it is dormant it does not produce cold sores. When there are risk factors like stress in any form, physical stress, mental/emotional stress, recent illness, surgeries, prolonged sun exposure can trigger cold sores. When there are active sores with blisters and fluid in it, the person who does not have HSV can contract the virus and produce cold sores. Since you already carry HSV, you can have a cold sore with above-mentioned risk factors and it may not increase the chance of getting a cold sore as there were no blisters at the time of contact (kiss).

Zoloft is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), which may cause a disturbance in these ions (sodium and chloride) hence may cause it. Get the blood test done serum sodium and serum chloride, or you may try increasing salt intake in your diet. Which if improves your problem then it is undoubtedly due to low sodium and chloride.

First, she started off with a protected blowjob followed by protected sex which lasted no more than 30 seconds.My concern is that three to four hours prior to sex, I shaved my penis and got a tiny cut on the shaft. Although during the entire activity I made sure that the cut was covered with the condom, but still wanted to check if this was a risk situation. I am worrying a lot. Please help.",
      "answer": "Hello. I have noted your concern. Protected sex is safe as far as risk of HIV is concerned. However, there is still a risk of genital herpes, HPV infection or warts as a condom does not cover the entire penis and there is some uncovered skin at the base of the penis for a skin to skin contact. If the cut was covered, it obviously does not increase the risk. Even if it was exposed, then HIV is still not a risk as it has to be a fresh actively bleeding cut for the virus to pass through. A paper thin cut that is a few hours old is self-sealing. Regards. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online  Take care."

I have then left it for around two and a half months and I have slowly tried to get back into exercise. I started by cycling which I had no problems with I have also been away skiing and I have not felt any pain whatsoever. However, since I came back from skiing I went to play football yesterday and although I was fine for the majority of the game once the game had finished I noticed my hamstring felt sore. It also is still a little bit sore this morning, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I could easily run on it now no problem but it does feel slightly sore. Is there anything I should or should not do?",
      "answer": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I read your concern. In my opinion, you had enough time to recover from tears. However, a grade 3 hamstring injury needs a bit more concentrated management. I think you should do proper rehabilitation to completely gain strength and stability. Exercises like bridging, single-leg bridges, clamshell, swiss ball jackknife, swiss ball hamstring curls, step-ups, and goblet squats will help you gain stability and strength. Slowly you should start running. If everything goes well then you should start gradual progressive running sessions. These exercises to be done for three weeks and then progress with the next level of rehabilitation. After progressing to full strength and stability and once you are confident then slowly you should return to play. I hope this helps."

      "question": "Hello doctor,The query is about sanded grout exposure. I am quite concerned about my girlfriend's exposure to silica dust. We were doing a home renovation. I left for about 1.5 hours while she was removing tile in a kitchen. When I had come back I saw she was removing grout with a grinder and no dust mask. The room was filled with dust in the air. The room is about 10x9 with 12\\\\x80\\\\x9d tiles. This makes for a total cut distance of 1100\\\\x80\\\\x9d with the grinder. Assuming a 1/8\\\\x80\\\\x9d cut with a depth of 3/8\\\\x80\\\\x9d and this works out to 51.56 cubic inches of dust released into the air. Assuming an average of 25 % silica content in the grout and weight of 38 g per cu inch for the dust, that is about 490 grams of silica dust releases into the air. The room was open to adjacent rooms so I estimated about 90 cubic meter space, wich would work out to 5.4 g/m^3. She was doing this for about an hour and a half so I estimate about 1 m^3 was inhaled.

      "question": "Hello doctor,I have had back pain for the last 12 years. I had an l5 s1 disc herniation and later diagnosed with severe lumbar spinal stenosis at l4 l5 as well. My back pain is more critical than the leg pain. However, I have persistent calf and foot spasms and cramping (especially in bed and at night). I am able to exercise and lift heavy objects, but not able to walk more than a mile at a time. I believe the stenosis is more of an issue right now than the disc herniation, and my MRI confirms the disc is not as bad as it was years ago.I have done physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, and epidural injections, but, my lower back pain remains an issue (especially when standing and walking for a long time). My doctors recommend a laminectomy, though I am scared that surgery may leave me in worse shape than I currently am. Can I have some advice? Should I go through with the laminectomy, or should I deal with the back pain since I have built a high tolerance for pain and can do most (but not all) activities?",
      "answer": "Hello. You are quite aware of the condition and have managed to live with the issue, but as you say, you cannot walk not than a mile, but it does not seem to be your main issue. If you required to walk longer, then laminectomy will be the solution, but you need to get relief from back pain. I will hazard a guess that this is from local instability, faceted, or discal. I will say that because that is usually the reason for back pain in patients with disc issues. Lumbar canal stenosis will not often give rise to back pain. I will recommend that you discuss this with your doctor and perhaps go for laminectomy and pedicle screw stabilization as this will help relieve both issues."

It is not necessary that she should get her mensus on that very date itself. If pregnancy is ruled out with a urine pregnancy test, then the most common cause of delayed menses is stress per se, which can be either psychological, emotional or physical which can cause a hormonal imbalance and can cause a possible delay in the periods.

      "answer": "Hello. As your serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) result is also negative it definitely indicates you have not got pregnant in this cycle. The symptoms you have mentioned could also be possible because of the progesterone hormone secretion in the postovulatory phase which may mimic pregnancy and the spotting could be due to the breakthrough bleed.

Sometimes the nerves regenerate from the apical end and start causing infection, it may happen due to food stuck around margins of gums for a long time, etc. There are two lines of treatment to it. 1. Medications- Take Augmentin 625 mg, tablet Metronidazole 400 mg and Brufen 400 mg for five days, twice a day. It will heal the infection and there will be no need for further treatment, your tooth will be back to normal. 2. If infection recurs after medicine regime like in 2 or 6 months with severe pain then cap will be removed for a while, re-endo or root canal treatment will be done, that is, deep cleaning of roots will be done and then it will be sealed again once infection is gone and tooth cap will be put again. There is also a third option that is a severe one, if root canal treated tooth is stuck with it then sometimes we have no option left except for extraction.
